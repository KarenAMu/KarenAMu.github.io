  <h1>Hi. My name is Karen.</h1>
  <p>Thank you for visiting my site!</p>
  <p> Number of days working on this website: 2 days!</p>
  <p>FAQ:</p>
  <p>How am I doing?</p>
  <p>	Fine, really not much is happening. If something important pops up, I'll mention it here on this website.</p>
  <p>How is school?</p>
   <p>	Bold question, but it's not too bad. I've seen better days, but I've also seen worse. Now on winter break,
    currently trying to find a summer internship. Really fun, exciting stuff.</p>
  <p>How is your health?</p>
   <p>	Currently still alive and breathing, so I mean it can't be TOO bad.</p>
